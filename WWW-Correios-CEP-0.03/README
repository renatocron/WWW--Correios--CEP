    WWW::Correios::CEP - Perl extension for extract address from CEP (zip
    code) number

SYNOPSIS
            use WWW::Correios::CEP;

            my $cepper = new WWW::Correios::CEP();

            my $address = $cepper->find( $cep );
            # returns hashref like { street => '', neighborhood => '', location => '', uf => 'SP', cep => '', status => '' }

    note: if you call "find" before "test" and require_tests is true, tests
    will be called

DESCRIPTION
    This is the documentation for WWW::Correios::CEP

METHODS
    List of methods

  new
    Create an instance of WWW::Correios::CEP and configures it

    Parameters: timeout require_tests with_tests user_agent post_url
    post_content lwp_options

    You can see details on "Full Sample" below

  find( $cep )
    Recive and CEP and try to get it address returning an hash ref with
    street, neighborhood, location, uf, cep and status.

    If you call this method on an array scope, it returns an array with each
    address, if not, address_count key is added to the hash.

  tests( )
    This method make tests on some address for test if WWW::Correios::CEP
    still ok, you may want keep this, these tests use some time, but it
    depends on your connection speed/correios site speed.

    Retuns 1 if all tests are ok, if false, you may want to call dump_tests
    to see the changes

  dump_tests( )
    prints on STDOUT results of each test

  $cepper->setTests( $array_ref_of_hash )
    You can change tests after new too, but you need to call
    $cepper->tests() if it already called.

    $array_ref_of_hash should be an array ref with hashs like "with_tests"
    bellow

  getTests( )
    return current tests array

Full Sample
            my $cepper = new WWW::Correios::CEP(
                    # this is default, you can disable it with a explicit false value,
                    require_tests => 1,

                    lwp_options  => {timeout => 10},
                    timeout      => 30, # 30 sec override 10 sec above, same as user_agent
                    # if you want to change user agent, that defaults to Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)
                    user_agent => 'IECA',

                    # theses tests may fail if the Correios page have changed.
                    # Nevertheless, to not break this class when address/cep changes, you can set a your tests here
                    with_tests => [

            );

            eval{$cepper->tests()};
            if($@){
                    # you can use $@ if you want just error message
                    $cepper->dump_tests;
            }else{
                    my $address = $cepper->find( $cep );

                    # returns hashref like { street => '', neighborhood => '', location => '', uf => 'SP', cep => '', status => '', address_count => 0 }

                    # you can also call find like it:
                    my @address = $cepper->find( $cep );
